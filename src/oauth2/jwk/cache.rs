//! JWT Key Cache Management
//!
//! This module implements the caching mechanisms for JWT keys, including:
//! - Direct cache access functions
//! - Cache update operations
//! - Lock management for thread-safe cache access
//! - Cache invalidation strategies
//!
//! The caching system uses RwLocks for efficient concurrent reads with exclusive writes
//! and atomic operations for coordinating refresh operations across threads.
//!
//! See the [module-level documentation](super) for a more detailed overview and usage.

    /// Retrieves JWT keys directly from cache without validation or refresh attempts
    ///
    /// This is a low-level utility method that provides direct access to the JWT keys
    /// stored in the cache. Unlike higher-level methods such as
    /// [`Self::check_cache_and_trigger_background_refresh`], this method:
    ///
    /// - Does not check if the cached keys are expired
    /// - Does not trigger background refresh tasks
    /// - Does not attempt to fetch new keys if the cache is empty
    /// - Acquires only a read lock (safe for concurrent access)
    ///
    /// # Use Cases
    ///
    /// - Use when you need quick access to keys and expiration doesn't matter
    /// - Use after a refresh operation when you know the cache should be populated
    /// - Use when you've already checked validity elsewhere and just need the keys
    /// - Use when implementing custom caching logic that needs the raw keys
    ///
    /// # Thread Safety
    ///
    /// This method acquires a read lock on the cache, allowing multiple concurrent
    /// readers without blocking each other. The lock is automatically released when
    /// the method returns.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// - Some([`EveJwtKeys`]) if keys are present in the cache (valid or not)
    /// - [`None`] if the cache is empty (no keys have been fetched yet). This typically
    ///   triggers a fetch operation with retry logic when called from higher-level methods.
