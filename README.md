# EVE ESI

Functions to easily interact with [EVE Online's ESI](https://esi.evetech.net/ui/).

## Getting Started

1. Initialize ESI in your main function using the `initialize_eve_esi` function which will set the user agent, this includes your application name & contact email if CCP needs to reach out to you for any reason.
2. Use ESI routes as needed from there.

## Notes

- More ESI routes will be added as needed, feel free to submit pull requests to add any you may need.
- Only public ESI routes are available, private routes will be added at a later date.
